#Attention
I don't speak english well.
The library did not make a very good test urgently.
Very carefully use it.

# What is it?
Google's common Java, C++ and JavaScript library for parsing, formatting, and validating international phone numbers.
https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber

Google's libphpnumber javascript version convert Actionscript3.
Only PhoneNumberUtil Class and Meatadata convert it.

# Available of functionality
  * Parsing/formatting/validating phone numbers for all countries/regions of the world.
  * ` getNumberType ` - gets the type of the number based on the number itself; able to distinguish Fixed-line, Mobile, Toll-free, Premium Rate, Shared Cost, VoIP and Personal Numbers  (whenever feasible).
  * ` isNumberMatch ` - gets a confidence level on whether two numbers could be the same.
  * ` getExampleNumber ` - provides valid example numbers for all countries/regions, with the option of specifying which type of example phone number is needed.
  * ` isPossibleNumber ` - quickly guessing whether a number is a possible phonenumber by using only the length information, much faster than a full validation.
  * ` isValidNumber ` - full validation of a phone number for a region using length and prefix information.
